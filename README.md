# Calculator built with ClojureScript and React

See the [full screencast on Lambda Island](https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/react-app-clojurescript).

Try out [the demo](http://lambdaisland.github.io/react-calculator/resources/public/index.html).

## How to run this

### Figwheel plugin

The easiest is to run `lein figwheel` from a terminal, then browse to
[http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

### From a Clojure REPL

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(run)
(browser-repl)
```

Now browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449), and you should
have a browser connected REPL. The nice thing about this approach is that you
can use it with any editor that provides a Clojure REPL.

### Emacs/CIDER

CIDER is able to start both a Clojure and a ClojureScript REPL simultaneously,
so you can interact both with the browser, and with the server. The command to
do this is `M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript`.

We need to tell CIDER how to start a browser-connected Figwheel REPL though,
otherwise it will use a JavaScript engine provided by the JVM, and you won't be
able to interact with your running app.

Put this in your Emacs configuration (`~/.emacs.d/init.el` or `~/.emacs`)

``` emacs-lisp
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl
      "(do (user/run)
           (user/browser-repl))")
```

Now `M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript` (shortcut: `C-c M-J`, that's a capital
"J", so `Meta-Shift-j`), point your browser at `http://localhost:3449`, and
you're good to go.

### Lighttable

Lighttable provides a tighter integration for live coding with an inline
browser-tab. Rather than evaluating cljs on the command line with the Figwheel
REPL, you can evaluate code and preview pages inside Lighttable.

Steps: After running `(run)`, open a browser tab in Lighttable. Open a cljs file
from within a project, go to the end of an s-expression and hit Cmd-ENT.
Lighttable will ask you which client to connect. Click 'Connect a client' and
select 'Browser'. Browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449)

View LT's console to see a Chrome js console.

Hereafter, you can save a file and see changes or evaluate cljs code (without
saving a file).

## Deploying to Heroku

This assumes you have a
[Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc), have installed the
[Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and have done a
`heroku login` before.

``` sh
git init
git add -A
git commit
heroku create
git push heroku master:master
heroku open
```

## Running with Foreman

Heroku uses [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to run your
app, which uses the `Procfile` in your repository to figure out which
server command to run. Heroku also compiles and runs your code with a
Leiningen "production" profile, instead of "dev". To locally simulate
what Heroku does you can do:

``` sh
lein with-profile -dev,+production uberjar && foreman start
```

Now your app is running at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in production mode.
